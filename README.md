QuantumKey: Your Quantum Leap in Password Security

Welcome to **QuantumKey**! This cutting-edge password generator blends modern cryptographic magic with user-friendly features to deliver passwords that are both strong and unique. Perfect for keeping your digital life under lock and key!

## Recommended IDE Setup

- **[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** + **[Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar)** (and disable Vetur for a smoother experience).

## TypeScript & Vue Integration

TypeScript needs a little extra help to understand `.vue` files. We use `vue-tsc` for type-checking and **Volar** to keep the TypeScript language service in sync with `.vue` types.

## Project Setup

### Install Dependencies

Start by installing the project's dependencies:

```sh

# Install browsers (only needed the first time)

npx playwright install

# Build the project (required before running tests)

npm run build

# Run all end-to-end tests

npm run test:e2e
